# ⚡Power System Fault Detection System

Power System Fault Detection System is a Machine Learning project that provides the expected fault occured based on the given inputes, it is build as an assingnment for IBM (AICTE) Internship using IBM Watsonx.ai studio for runtime services and IBM Cloud for storage services , the project proves to deliver friendly, real-time prediction through natural language for simplicity.

# 💡Project overview

This Project was developed as a part of the IBM (AICTE) Internship on AI and Cloud by Edunet Foundation. Using IBM's AI tools and effective machine learning models, The Power system Fault detection system simulates a real-time and effective prediction of the fault based on the previous records of data provided.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

💠IBM Watsonx.ai - TO build and run the machine learning model using the natural language.     

💠Watsonx.ai Runtime - For executing and managing the deployed agent.

💠AutoAI - no code interface for designing, testing, and deploying the machine learning model.

💠IBM Cloud Lite Plan - Used for cloud-based development and deployment.

# 🚀 Features
